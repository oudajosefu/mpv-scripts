# mpv-scripts
My own mpv scripts, built for use with Japanese subtitles. macOS is required and use with [IINA](https://github.com/iina/iina) is recommended.

### Installation
Available at top of file. To summarize, simply add the script into your `~/.config/mpv/scripts/` folder, and if using IINA be sure to add the correct Key Bindings as stated within the script.
